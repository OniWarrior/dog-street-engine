# dog-street-engine
This is a game engine I'm trying to develop for the sake of increasing my engineering skills.
## Language
The language that will be used is Python. This is due to the complexity of modern day engines.
## Physics Engine
The physics engine will be middleware functions that will be used to deal with how objects will move and interact
with one another.
